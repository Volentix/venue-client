$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server 
$ npm run build

# Start the client server, specifying where the API server is running (see [venue-server](https://github.com/Volentix/venue-server))
$ API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
